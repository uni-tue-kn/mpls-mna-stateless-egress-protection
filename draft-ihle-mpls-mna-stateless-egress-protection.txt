              Stateless MNA-based Egress Protection (SMEP)
         draft-ihle-mpls-mna-stateless-egress-protection-latest

Abstract

   The MPLS Network Action (MNA) framework provides a general mechanism
   for the encoding and processing of network actions and their data.

   The MPLS Egress Protection Framework specifies a fast reroute
   framework for protecting IP/MPLS services.  To that end bypass
   tunnels have to be signaled to the Point of Local Repair (PLR).
   Further, the PLR must maintain the bypass forwarding state.

   This document defines the encoding for the Stateless MNA-based Egress
   Protection (SMEP) network action.  The SMEP network action protects
   egress routers by providing an alternative MPLS egress label in-
   stack.  SMEP does not require a bypass forwarding state in PLRs.

1.  Introduction

   MPLS egress protection in [RFC8679] establishes bypass tunnels for
   egress routers on an egress failure, i.e., on a node or a link
   failure.  This is referred to as egress protection.  The protection
   mechanism relies on a Point of Local Repair (PLR) to perform local
   failure detection and local repair.  Typically, this PLR is the
   penultimate router.  When an egress failure occurs, packets are
   rerouted to an alternative egress router.  The PLR must maintain a
   list of bypass tunnels and the bypass forwarding state on a per-
   transport-tunnel basis.  Typically, this is done using context label
   switching.  The PLR node maintains the bypass forwarding state, which
   is a mapping of context labels to bypass tunnels.  The bypass tunnels
   are signaled using existing mechanisms, i.e., via an IGP, or
   topology-driven label distribution protocols such as LDP.

   With the MPLS Network Action (MNA) framework, network actions are
   encoded in the MPLS stack.  [I-D.ietf-mpls-mna-hdr] defines the
   encoding of such network actions and their data in the MPLS stack.
   These network actions are processed by all nodes on a path (hop-by-
   hop), by only selected nodes, or on an ingress-to-egress basis.

   This document defines the Stateless MNA-based Egress Protection
   (SMEP) network action.  With SMEP, egress bypass tunnels are carried
   in a network action in the MPLS stack.  The egress bypass tunnel is
   indicated by an alternative MPLS forwarding label in-stack.  This is
   called the BML (BML).  The ingress router pushes the MPLS stack
   containing the SMEP network action.  On an egress failure, the BML in
   the network action is used to protect the egress tunnel.  The PLR
   node is required to install the MPLS forwarding entries for the
   bypass tunnels using the BML.  Beside that, no additional signaling
   is required for this approach and no state needs to be maintained in
   the PLR.

2.  MPLS Network Action for Stateless Egress Protection

   In this section, we describe the encoding of SMEP and the processing
   of SMEP in an LSR.

                               bypass labels.

   The network action for stateless MNA-based egress protection is
   encoded as follows:

   *  Network Action Indication: The SMEP network action is indicated by
      opcode TBA1.

   *  Format: The SMEP network action MUST be encoded using a Format C
      LSE as defined in [I-D.ietf-mpls-mna-hdr], see Figure 1.
      Optionally, a list of BMLs MAY be carried as Format D LSE, see
      Figure 2.

   *  Scope: The SMEP network action is only valid in the select scope.

   *  Ancillary Data: The SMEP network action requires 20 bits of in-
      stack ancillary data to encode the BML.  The most-significant 16
      bit of the BML are located in the first data field of an Format C
      LSE.  The least-significant 4 bit are located in the second
      datafield of an Format C LSE.  If Format D LSEs are provided, the
      BML is encoded in the least-significant bits of the first data
      field of an Format D LSE.  The two most-significant bits of the
      first data field, and the 8 bits of the second data field MUST be
      set to zero.  No post-stack data is required.

2.2.  Processing

   The ingress LER which pushes an MPLS label stack onto a packet
   includes the BML in a network action.  The BML encodes the bypass
   tunnel to an alternative egress router.  The SMEP network action MUST
   be placed in the MPLS stack such that the PLR (Point of Local
   Repair), i.e., the penultimate node, is able to process the network
   action.  This means that the SMEP network action is only processed by
   the penultimate node using the select scope.  On an egress node
   failure or an egress link failure, the penultimate node MUST use the
   BML to route traffic to an alternative egress router.  To that end,
   the PLR pushes the BML from the Format C and D LSEs to the MPLS stack
   and pops the incoming label.  A list of BMLs MAY be provided as
   Format D LSEs to encode a bypass tunnel constructed by Segment
   Routing.

3.  Example

   A simple example topology using MNA-based egress protection with an
   SR bypass tunnel is shown in Figure 3.  Labels A and B are used to
   forward to the penultimate router.  From here, two paths are
   available to an egress node.  Label C is used to route to the egress
   node, and labels C' and C'' are used to route to the backup egress
   node.  If the egress link or router C fails, the PLR can use the
   bypass tunnel of router C' and C''.  The MPLS stack pushed by the
   ingress LER that encodes this functionality for the example topology
   is shown in Figure 4.  The Network Action Sub-Stack (NAS) for SMEP
   contains an Format A LSE to indicate the MNA sub-Stack and an Format
   B LSE.  This is required by [I-D.ietf-mpls-mna-hdr].  The Format B
   LSE can contain arbitrary network actions.

   In the example, LSR A and B pop the labels A and B.  On an egress
   failure, the PLR pops the incoming label C, and the NAS, and pushes
   the list of BMLs onto the stack.  The label stack after SMEP is
   applied is shown in Figure 5.
